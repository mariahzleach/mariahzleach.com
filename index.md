Mariah Z. Leach (she/her/hers) is a writer, patient advocate, and mother of three based in Colorado. Diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 25, she has transformed her personal health challenges into a mission to support others who are navigating similar paths. 

She launched her advocacy work in 2008 with her award-winning personal blog, [From This Point. Forward](http://www.fromthispointforward.com), chronicling her life as a young graduate student adjusting to a life-changing diagnosis. After learning firsthand how challenging and lonely it can be to face pregnancy and motherhood with chronic illness, Mariah launched [Mamas Facing Forward](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mamasfacingforward), a private Facebook support group, which later expanded into [MamasFacingForward.com](https://www.mamasfacingforward.com), dedicated to providing resources and support for parents and parents-to-be with chronic illness.

Mariah graduated with honors from Princeton University in 2005, and completed a dual degree program at the University of Colorado in 2010, earning a JD and an MS in environmental science. She has co-authored two books: [Hydrocarbon Hucksters: Lessons from Louisiana on Oil, Politics, and Environmental Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17783332-hydrocarbon-hucksters) (2014) and [International Environmental Law in a Nutshell, 5th Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35519769-international-environmental-law-in-a-nutshell) (2017). 

Mariah’s writing has also been published in a variety of health-oriented websites and magazines, including: Arthritis Today, Health Union, Healthline, the INVisible Project, Rheumatology Network, Rheumatology Nurse Practice, and Women magazine. Her writing blends practical advice, emotional honesty, and a deep commitment to helping others live fully—no matter the challenges. She is currently working on a memoir about pregnancy with chronic illness.
